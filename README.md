# MtG-DeckBox

This repository contains code for an assignment I wrote. The goal was to build a mobile Android application which allows users to build decks for the popular
trading card game, Magic: the Gathering. Although incomplete, the basic features of the application necessary to fulfill the assessment requirements were
completed. The application allows users to create an account, sign in, create new decks and edit existing ones, search for cards, view graphs and recommendations
and more.

## Technical Features
* Android Room SQL database for local storage.
* Android Navigation Drawers.
* Standard Android layout features such as RecyclerView, TabbedLayoutView etc.
* Google Firebase integration to allow users to create and authenticate using an online account.
* Google Retrofit integration to allow for API calls (used to retrieve card images from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)).

## Where's the code?
Please visit the [app/src/main/java/com/example/mtgdeckbox folder](https://github.com/TPBarker/MtG-DeckBox/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/mtgdeckbox) to
view the code I wrote as part of the application (many of the other directories are filled with files and code generated by Android Studio).
